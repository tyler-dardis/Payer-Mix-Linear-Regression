**Objective:** Develop a linear regression model to predict the payer mix of health centers.

**Data:** 2018-2023 Uniform Data System dataset (from the [HRSA website](data.HRSA.gov))

**Model Type:** Linear regression

**Tools/Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Summary

For this predictive modeling project, I built a linear regression model for predicting payer mix at health centers, using the annual Uniform Data System dataset published by HRSA. I first prepared the data for the model and then ran a simple linear regression to evaluate the baseline performance. Last, I used lasso regression to fine tune the model and help select features that were most relevant to payer mix prediction.
